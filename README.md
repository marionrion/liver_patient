# Liver Health Assessment Project

## Project Overview

Liver diseases are a growing concern globally, with millions of people affected. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict liver health problems using biochemical and demographic data. The ultimate goal is to create a model that supports healthcare professionals in making early and accurate diagnoses, improving patient outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Multiple models are developed and evaluated, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, among others, to predict liver health issues based on input features like bilirubin levels, enzymes, and proteins.
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, outliers, and feature scaling ensures the model's robustness and reliability.
- **Actionable Insights**: The project not only focuses on model accuracy but also provides insights into which biochemical indicators most impact liver health, potentially guiding healthcare practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries to illustrate patterns and model performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The development environment for the project, with code, analysis, and results presented in an interactive format.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liver-health-assessment.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Explore the Data**:
   The notebook provides an in-depth exploration of the dataset, including visualizations, preprocessing steps, and model comparisons.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   Follow the steps in the notebook to see how different machine learning models perform in predicting liver health.

## Project Structure

- **/data**: Contains the liver health dataset.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebook with detailed steps from data exploration to model development and evaluation.
- **/models**: Saved models for future deployment or reuse.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python libraries and dependencies used in the project.

## Evaluation Metrics

The success of the machine learning models is measured using:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision and Recall**: To evaluate the model’s performance, especially in identifying liver disease cases.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Results and Insights

The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of over 85%, with significant precision and recall metrics, making it a reliable tool for predicting liver disease. Additionally, the analysis reveals that specific indicators such as **bilirubin levels** and **enzyme concentrations** play a critical role in diagnosing liver conditions.

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization**: Further fine-tuning the model to improve accuracy and generalization.
- **Deployment**: Packaging the model into an API for easy integration into healthcare systems.
- **Real-World Testing**: Collaborating with healthcare institutions to validate the model in real-world scenarios.
